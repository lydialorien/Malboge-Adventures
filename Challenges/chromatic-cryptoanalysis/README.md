# Chromatic Cryptanalysis

## About

Greetings, fellow cryptographers and enigma solvers! I'm Lydia Lorien, and I invite you to immerse yourself in the world of cryptographic intrigue. Within the Malboge-Adventures repository, **Chromatic Cryptanalysis** stands as a testament to my unyielding dedication to crafting innovative solutions using the chaotic language of Malbolge.

## Project Overview

In **Chromatic Cryptanalysis**, I marry cryptography with artistry, using color-based decryption to reveal the secrets concealed within Malbolge-encoded text. Each color holds significance, weaving a tapestry of patterns that only the keenest minds can unravel.

## How It Works

The decryption process in **Chromatic Cryptanalysis** involves harnessing the dynamic memory states of a running Malbolge program to generate decryption keys. The colors extracted from the chaotic states are used to unlock the encrypted text, revealing messages that defy the ordinary and challenge the extraordinary.

## Getting Involved

If you're a cryptography enthusiast seeking novel challenges or an artist intrigued by the symbiosis of logic and color, **Chromatic Cryptanalysis** beckons you. Delve into the intricacies of color-based decryption, experiment with different approaches, and join me in the journey of decoding enigmatic messages.

## Discover More

To explore my expeditions in cryptography, programming, and beyond, venture forth into the [Malboge-Adventures repository](../README.md). As we navigate the vibrant spectrum of cryptanalysis, let us unravel the nuances of code and color, unveiling the unseen one shade at a time.
